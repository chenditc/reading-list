## Others
 - [The Millionaire Fastlane: Crack the Code to Wealth and Live Rich for a Lifetime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BDOUAI/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)
   - Interesting opinion regarding wealth creation. I agreed with most of idea that "Making a money making machine is the only way to financial freedom", but it spend too much time to emphasize this simple idea. 
 - [Game Theory: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SHOV78/)
   - Covered most fundamental idea about game theory and it has some interesting example to help reader understand. The graph is not so helpful for me, so I skipped most of the graph explaination.  
 - [The Brain: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N19DQ0/)
   - Talked about how historically people think brain works, and how people do experiment to understand it. It also provide some insight for neural network AI worker. It sounds like we still have a lot of unknown regarding our brain, and they are critical to make a powerful AI.
 - [Entrepreneurship: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G5H306S/)
   - Not recommended. This is mostly talking about what is Entrepreneurship and how it get developped in different circumstance, which is not so interested if you are not doing research about Entrepreneurship. Since it's research oriented, it sounds very far from current era.
 - [Emotion: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CQIARY/)
   - Cool book. It provides insight regarding "What is emotion? Why do we have emotion? Is it good or bad?". After reading this, it helps me control my emotion because I can sometimes intentify what emotion is helpful for me. 
   - Eg. Angry is helpful when you think about the social activity as a infinite recurring game, but not so helpful if you are with people that won't appear in your life again. Why? Read the book.
 - [Quantum Theory: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CGNQ50)
   - Very good book about quantum theory. Might be a little bit hard for people don't have good physics background. I did read some qunatum theory related book during high school. This book introduced the history of the "quantum". Also it use some classical experiment to illustrate how quantum behaves different from classic physics particle. It helps programmer if they want to try out the quantum computer. Eg. [IBM quantum computer cloud](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qstage/#/login)
 - [Forensic Psychology: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OQGCKW)
   - Not so interesting. It talked about the role of psychology in the court. There are some discussion about "What if a men is mentally disordered? How to determine that?" is interesting. And some fact about "criminal mental help" is also interesting. It turns out criminal might find a way to pretend to be "healed" during the community helping group.
