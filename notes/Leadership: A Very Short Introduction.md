 - Sunzi (孙子) discussed leadership using military activity as example. Leader should not enagage unnecessary battle. (不战而屈人之兵，善之善者也)
 - Sunzi: When engage the enemy, should plan for their escape route, but don't chase down. (穷寇莫追)
 - Plato believe some democratic can hurt the society, eg. leader is elected by choosing the one promise most, instead of most qualified.
 - Book *The Prince*: Moral leader can be destroyed by immoral people, like bad money drives out good (劣币驱逐良币). If you can't be both loved and hated, choose to be hated. Because the bond of love can be destroyed when you are out of power, but the fear will last for a long time.
 - Two management pattern:
   1. Manage by heoric leader personality
   2. Manage by systematic process.
 - Is leader born or bred?
   - No agreed conclusion.
   - Two example:
     1. Hitler. Not famous when young, but deterministic
     2. Stalin. Famous when young.
 - Leadership might be borned, aka build into our gene. Proof: leadership among animals.

06/15:
 - Follower teaches leader.
  - Like how children teach parent, the feedback from follower teaches leader. 
  - Leader like hear "yes", but the "yes" suggestion might not be useful.（忠言逆耳利于行）
  - Leadership experience come from failure, experience prevent future failure. So leader should be put in a risky environemtn, so that he can fail and learn.
  - Organization should provide a environment that's difficult / risky for leader, but not too risky, so that no catastrophic failure can occur.

06/19:
 - Leadership is a relationship. If no follower follow the leader, the leadership means nothing.

06/20:
 - How does leader leads?
  - There are two dimensions:
    1. Follower oriented. 
      - By having a good relationship with followers, follower will be productive even leader is not present.
    2. Production oriented.
      - By making a clear process and make task clear, follower will be more productive when leader is present, but not productive when leader is not present.
  - Leadership style depends on follower style, for different follower, different leadership stype works differently. (因材施教）
    - For the followers that's enthusiastic, give the general goal and build a good relationship.
    - For the followers that just do the work blindly, give clear instruction and task specification.
