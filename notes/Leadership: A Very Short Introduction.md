 - Plato believe some democratic can hurt the society, eg. leader is elected by choosing the one promise most, instead of most qualified.
 - Book *The Prince*: Moral leader can be destroyed by immoral people, like bad money drives out good (劣币驱逐良币). If you can't be both loved and hated, choose to be hated. Because the bond of love can be destroyed when you are out of power, but the fear will last for a long time.
 - Two management pattern:
   1. Manage by heoric leader personality
   2. Manage by systematic process.
 - Is leader born or bred?
   - No agreed conclusion.
   - Two example:
     1. Hitler. Not famous when young, but deterministic
     2. Stalin. Famous when young.
